## Technologies

ES6: See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) for details.

Babel: Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.  see [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for details.

vue.js: Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex. see [here](https://vuejs.org/)


nuxt.js: Nuxt.js is a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js. Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js. The framework is advertised as a "Meta-framework for universal applications". see [here](https://nuxtjs.org/)

Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains HTML, CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. see [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
